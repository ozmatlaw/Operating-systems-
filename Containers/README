Q1:
One general use of Linux PID Namespaces is to provide processes with an independent set of process IDs (PIDs) from
other namespaces.
PID namespaces are nested, meaning when a new process is created it will have a PID for each namespace from its current
namespace up to the initial PID namespace.

Q2:
Creating a separate mount namespace allows each of these isolated processes to have a completely different view of the
entire system's mountpoint structure from the original one.
This allows us to have a different root for each isolated process, as well as other mountpoints that are specific to
those processes.

Q3:
cgroups allow processes to be organized into hierarchical groups whose usage of various types of resources can then be
limited and monitored.

Q4:
The clone command is the syscall used by fork(). With some parameters, it creates a new process, with others, it
creates a thread.
The difference between them is which data structures (memory space, processor state, stack, PID, open files, etc)
are shared.

Q5:
chroot command in Linux system is used to change the root directory. Every process or command in Linux like systems
has a current working directory called root directory.
It changes the root directory for currently running processes as well as its child processes.

Q6:
Proc file system (procfs) is virtual file system created when the system boots and is deleted when the system
shuts down.
It contains useful information about the processes that are currently running, it is regarded as control and
information center for kernel
